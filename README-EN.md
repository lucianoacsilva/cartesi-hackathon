# Tofen Payment Solutions (TPS)

Tofen Payment Solutions is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that utilizes blockchain technology to enhance the efficiency of international financial transactions. Our core operation involves converting national currencies from initial payments into ERC20 tokens destined for the digital wallets of final receiving financial institutions. This reduces transaction processing time, operational costs such as exchange rates, and strengthens the security of operations.

Slogan: Tofen, smoother international financial transactions with tokens!

## Motivation

International financial transactions face significant challenges such as high fees, hidden costs, transactional delays, and risks of fraud and security breaches.

### High fees and hidden costs

High fees charged by banks and financial intermediaries, coupled with hidden costs like exchange rates, increase the overall transaction cost.

### Slow processing

International transactions typically take longer to process due to the involvement of multiple intermediaries and compliance with cross-border regulations.

### Fraud and security risks

International transactions are prone to higher risks of fraud and fraudulent activities due to the complexity and lack of standardization in global financial systems. Personal and financial information security during the transfer process is also a concern.

### Technical challenges

Issues, roadblocks, or any other feedback in the development lifecycle can be identified in various areas. One such point of focus is currency conversion, where the question turns to which smart contracts can be implemented to automate the conversion process and how to handle currency fluctuations.

Another critical aspect is compliance with international regulations, which can result in fines and penalties from regulatory authorities, increasing operational costs for financial institutions. Non-compliance can also lead to loss of trust from customers and investors, negatively affecting the institution's reputation and reducing its customer base.

Furthermore, scalability and maintenance of the solution are significant challenges to address. It is essential to ensure that the developed solution can handle an increase in transaction volume and expansion into international markets. Measures must be taken to ensure the continuous maintenance and support of the solution after the initial implementation, using the development resources offered by the Cartesi platform and its community of developers.

## Target Audience
